        We have established the Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics [CSDF]. This center places emphasis on digital forensics and biometrics-based IoT security. Digital forensics is key to finding evidence of virtual crimes through use of virtualization technologies to simulate penetration testing, network architectures to monitor networked traffic and detect anomalies. Biometrics-based security solutions are a unique form of security that requires user and information to prevent successful cyber-attacks.  
<br><br> 
The need for establishing cybersecurity as a structured discipline is recognized throughout industry, government, and academia. Driven by significant workforce needs and societyâ€™s dependence on the global cyber infrastructure, cybersecurity is emerging as an identifiable discipline with a breadth and depth of content that encompasses software development, networking, database management, ethics, law, policy, human factors, and risk management. Cybersecurity education is becoming increasingly crucial for our society as many critical infrastructures are in the cyber domain and are becoming prime targets for cyberattacks. The many critical infrastructure sectors are vital to the extent that jeopardizing the functionality of any of these sectors would strongly impact the security, economic, health, and public safety of the nation. Cybersecurity specialists are needed to address the numerous cyberattacks that infrastructure sectors are subjected to, particularly in industry, government, and academia. 
<br><br> 
The CSDF center exists to protect the critical infrastructure sectors at all levels, from individual, to national. Biometrics based access control is key for preventing bad actors from gaining access to sensitive information, and digital forensics is essential for catching successful cybercrimes to prevent future attempts.
